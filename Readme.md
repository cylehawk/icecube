ICEcube is a Python library intended to help organize SAR images and annotations for supervised machine learning applications. The library generates multidimensional SAR image and labeled data arrays.

The datacubes stack SAR time-series images in range and azimuth and can preserve the geospatial content, intensity, and complex SAR signal from the <a href='http://www.iceye.com'>ICEYE</a> SAR images. You can use the datacubes with ICEYE Ground Range Detected (GRD) geotifs and ICEYE Single Look Complex (SLC) .hdf5 product formats.
